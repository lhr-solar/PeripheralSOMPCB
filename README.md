# PeripheralSOMPCB
The Peripheral System on Module takes in the SPI or I2C of the various Peripheral boards and sends that along a can bus. Used primarily by BPS and Data Acquisition

## Daughter Board Connector Pinout Usage Guide
 * SPI1 is the main SPI
    * If additional GPIOs are necessary, avoid using SPI1_MOSI and SPI1_SCK due to terminating resistors.
 * I2C1 is the main I2C
    * These pins cannot be used as GPIO due to pullups
 * SPI2 is a secondary SPI, used only if necessary
    * Primary usage for SPI2 should be GPIO
 * I2C2 is a secondary I2C, used only if necessary
    * Primary usage for I2C2 should be GPIO
    * Enable external Pullups () to use as I2C bus
 * PA1, PA2, and SPI1_NSS can be used as ADC inputs
 * VDDA and GNDA should be used only for voltage reference
    * Drawing significant current will result in unstable voltage output
